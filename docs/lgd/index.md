Collection of Data from [Local Government Directory](https://lgdirectory.gov.in) - [Copyright Policy](https://lgdirectory.gov.in/copyRightPolicy.do)([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230322190637/https://lgdirectory.gov.in/copyRightPolicy.do))

[Code](https://github.com/ramSeraph/opendata//tree/master/lgd) used to extract this data.


# Notes


Some of the data present here is also available at [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/catalog/local-government-directory-lgd)(updated monthly)

The archives use a zip format which is not understood by the standard unix `unzip` tool. Use [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the data from the archives instead.
